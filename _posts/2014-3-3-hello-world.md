title: Jekyll + Github + Markdown = Blog
---

Hello World!  Welcome to my new home for code blogging.  I'll keep the [regular blog](http://markedmondson.me) for all the other stuff, running on [Posthaven](https://posthaven.com/).

## Why?

Its educational, and free, and writing code posts using Posthaven's rich text editor was sometimes painful.  

Using this setup means its all written in Markdown so I get control over everything just the way I want it, and since it combines [`Github`](https://github.com) and [`Markdown`](https://help.github.com/articles/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/), two things I know well already, [`Jekyll`](https://jekyllrb.com/) seemed worth knowing.

## Setup

I followed the guide from [Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/) which meant I was up and running in 10 minutes.  There were a few things like updating the [Jekyll-now fork](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) to include the latest builds: 

e.g. I did have to edit these bits:

```yaml
markdown: kramdown
highlighter: rouge
```

...but I guess it will catch up soon.

I also would ideally have liked this to appear at http://markedmondson.me/code/hello-world but couldn't figure out how.  Who cares about SEO anyhow. ;)

## What to expect

I'll be hopefully putting my R package updates, Google Analytcs / Google Tag Manager guides, R data analytics and general digital analytics stuff here.
