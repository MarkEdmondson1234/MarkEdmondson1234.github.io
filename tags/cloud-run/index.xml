      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello blog, its been a long time.  Since I finished the GA4 book I have had a good break and lots of life events have happened such as a new job, philosophies and family arrangements, but I have always intended to pick this thread up again once I had an idea on where it would best lead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As old readers may remember, I&amp;rsquo;ve always tried to work on the meta-horizons of where I am, restlessly looking for the next exciting lesson, and that impulse has led me to Large Language Models (LLMs) sparked off by the Chat-GPT revolution, but foreshadowed by the image generation models such as Stable Diffusion a few months before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A key facilitator has been Harrison Chase&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://python.langchain.com&#34;&gt;Langchain&lt;/a&gt;, an active hive of open-source goodness.  It has allowed me to learn and imagine and digest this new active field of LLMops (Large Language Model Operations), that is the data engineering to make LLMs actually useful on a day to day basis.  I took it upon myself to see how I could apply my Google Cloud Platform (GCP) data engineering background to these new toys Langchain has helped provide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means I now have this new brain, Edmonbrain, that I converse with daily in Google Chat, Slack and Discord.  I have fed it in interesting URLs, Git repos and Whitepapers so I can build up a unique bot of my very own.  I fed it my own book, and can ask it questions about it, for example:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Google Tag Manager Server Side on Cloud Run - Pros and Cons</title>
      <link>https://code.markedmondson.me/gtm-serverside-cloudrun/</link>

      <description>One of the most exciting developments in 2020 for me is the launch of Google Tag Manager Server Side, which lies at the intersection of cloud and digital analytics that I&amp;rsquo;ve gravitated towards in recent years.
There are many good resources out there on GTM Serverside, Simo in particular has got me up to speed with his excellent range of posts. This post will assume you&amp;rsquo;ve read those, and be more about the viability of deploying GTM server side within Cloud Run.</description>

      <title>Shiny on Google Cloud Run - Scale-to-Zero R Web Apps</title>
      <link>https://code.markedmondson.me/shiny-cloudrun/</link>

      <description>There are some references on how to deploy Shiny apps to Cloud Run around the web and in various bits of my package documentation, but its a cool service so I thought it worth pulling out and having a blog post to refer to.
Why Shiny on Cloud Run? As mentioned in my R at scale on Google Cloud Platform post, Cloud Run is a container-as-a-service which lets you deploy Docker containers to the web without needing to worry about the infrastructure.</description>

      <title>R at scale on the Google Cloud Platform</title>

      <description>This post covers my current thinking on what I consider the optimal way to work with R on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP). It seems this has developed into my niche, and I get questions about it so would like to be able to point to a URL.
Both R and the GCP rapidly evolve, so this will have to be updated I guess at some point in the future, but even as things stand now you can do some wonderful things with R, and can multiply those out to potentially billions of users with GCP.</description>
