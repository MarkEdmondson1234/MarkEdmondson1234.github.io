      <description>There are some references on how to deploy Shiny apps to Cloud Run around the web and in various bits of my package documentation, but its a cool service so I thought it worth pulling out and having a blog post to refer to.
Why Shiny on Cloud Run? As mentioned in my R at scale on Google Cloud Platform post, Cloud Run is a container-as-a-service which lets you deploy Docker containers to the web without needing to worry about the infrastructure.</description>

      <description>This post covers my current thinking on what I consider the optimal way to work with R on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP). It seems this has developed into my niche, and I get questions about it so would like to be able to point to a URL.
Both R and the GCP rapidly evolve, so this will have to be updated I guess at some point in the future, but even as things stand now you can do some wonderful things with R, and can multiply those out to potentially billions of users with GCP.</description>
