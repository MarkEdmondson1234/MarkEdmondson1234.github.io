      <description>This post has been delayed due to the events of 2020 including a global pandemic and social justice demonstrations, if you are touched by those I wish you all the best. For my family and I we have been very lucky and spent most of the last months tending our garden in the Copenhagen suburbs, but others have been a lot more directly affected.
One consequence of the pandemic may be that from now on more interaction will be online, which presents both opportunities and challenges.</description>
