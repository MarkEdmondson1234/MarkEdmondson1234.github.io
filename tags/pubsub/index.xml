      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello blog, its been a long time.  Since I finished the GA4 book I have had a good break and lots of life events have happened such as a new job, philosophies and family arrangements, but I have always intended to pick this thread up again once I had an idea on where it would best lead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As old readers may remember, I&amp;rsquo;ve always tried to work on the meta-horizons of where I am, restlessly looking for the next exciting lesson, and that impulse has led me to Large Language Models (LLMs) sparked off by the Chat-GPT revolution, but foreshadowed by the image generation models such as Stable Diffusion a few months before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A key facilitator has been Harrison Chase&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://python.langchain.com&#34;&gt;Langchain&lt;/a&gt;, an active hive of open-source goodness.  It has allowed me to learn and imagine and digest this new active field of LLMops (Large Language Model Operations), that is the data engineering to make LLMs actually useful on a day to day basis.  I took it upon myself to see how I could apply my Google Cloud Platform (GCP) data engineering background to these new toys Langchain has helped provide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means I now have this new brain, Edmonbrain, that I converse with daily in Google Chat, Slack and Discord.  I have fed it in interesting URLs, Git repos and Whitepapers so I can build up a unique bot of my very own.  I fed it my own book, and can ask it questions about it, for example:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Activating GA4 events with GTM Server-Side and Pub/Sub for Fun and Profit</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image from &lt;a href=&#34;https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/resources/758/brief-outburst/?category=solar-system_sun&#34;&gt;https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/resources/758/brief-outburst/?category=solar-system_sun&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Google Tag Manager Server-side (GTM-SS), the scope on what you can do with your GA4 events is much enhanced, since using GTM-SS you have the ability to interact easily with other GCP services, in particular easier Google authentication.  This integration can allow you to enrich your data streams or send your GA4 data to different locations other than the Google Marketing Platform.  The first example of this has been using the BigQuery API in your GTM-SS templates to export your event data, but what if you need your event data on a more real-time basis?  For that, there is &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/overview&#34;&gt;Google Pub/Sub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Auto Google Analytics Data Imports from Cloud Storage</title>
      <link>https://code.markedmondson.me/automatic-google-analytics-data-imports-cloud-storage/</link>

      <description>Continuing my infatuation with cloud functions (see last post on using cloud functions to manipulate BigQuery exports) this is a post showing how to bring together various code examples out there so that you can easily upload custom data imports from a Google cloud storage bucket.
The code is available in this GitHub repo for useful cloud functions with Google Analytics
Extended data imports Google Analytics offers various versions of uploads.</description>
