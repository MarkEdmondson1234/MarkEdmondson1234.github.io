      <description>A full list of R packages I have published are on my Github, but some notable ones are below.
Some are part of the cloudyR project, which has many packages useful for using R in the cloud. I concentrate on the Google cloud below, but be sure to check out the other packages if youâ€™re looking to work with AWS or other cloud based services.

      <description>googleAuthR is now on CRAN version 0.2.0.
This release is the result of using the library myself to create three working Google API libraries, and tweaking the googleAuthR code to better support the process. As a result all of these libraries are now able to be authorised with one Google OAuth2 login flow:
 googleAnalyticsR searchConsoleR bigQueryR  Batching This means the libraries above and any other created with googleAuthR can take advatage of batching: this uses a Google API feature that means you can send multiple API calls at once.</description>
