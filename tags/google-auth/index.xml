      <description>This post has been delayed due to the events of 2020 including a global pandemic and social justice demonstrations, if you are touched by those I wish you all the best. For my family and I we have been very lucky and spent most of the last months tending our garden in the Copenhagen suburbs, but others have been a lot more directly affected.
One consequence of the pandemic may be that from now on more interaction will be online, which presents both opportunities and challenges.</description>

      <description>googleAuthR is now on CRAN version 0.2.0.
This release is the result of using the library myself to create three working Google API libraries, and tweaking the googleAuthR code to better support the process. As a result all of these libraries are now able to be authorised with one Google OAuth2 login flow:
googleAnalyticsR searchConsoleR bigQueryR Batching This means the libraries above and any other created with googleAuthR can take advatage of batching: this uses a Google API feature that means you can send multiple API calls at once.</description>
