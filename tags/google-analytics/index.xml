      <description>A new interest at the moment is engineering through various data privacy requirements with some of the new tools Google has available. With respect to my guiding principle of blogging about what I wish I could have read 6 months ago, I thought it worth writing about what is now possible. Data privacy engineering also requires clear thinking about the legal and technical details and so this will also help organise my communication around the subject.</description>

      <title>gago: Blazingly fast Google Analytics API downloads with Go</title>
      <link>https://code.markedmondson.me/gago/</link>

      <description>gago is a new Go library for working with the Google Analytics Reporting API v4.
I used it as a way to learn Go, transferring across some of the lessons I learned from working with the Google Analytics API in googleAnalyticsR. In particular how to get fast downloads and adding an anti-sample option, whilst taking advantage of Go&amp;rsquo;s natural multi-threaded nature.
The imagined use case is for when you need to download Google Analytics data but you don&amp;rsquo;t want to install an interpreted language such as Python or R to do so.</description>

      <description>Continuing my infatuation with cloud functions (see last post on using cloud functions to manipulate BigQuery exports) this is a post showing how to bring together various code examples out there so that you can easily upload custom data imports from a Google cloud storage bucket.
The code is available in this GitHub repo for useful cloud functions with Google Analytics
Extended data imports Google Analytics offers various versions of uploads.</description>

      <title>Turning GA360 BigQuery exports into partitioned tables using Cloud Functions</title>

      <description>Its been a while since my last blog, although I had a good excuse as I’ve moved house into the Copenhagen suburbs, Brønshøj. But in the meantime, I have had the chance to find my new favourite tool for data engineering - Google Cloud Functions in Python.
This post will look at how to use them to work with the GA360 BigQuery export tables.

      <title>Talking Google Analytics dashboards via R, Shiny and Text-to-Speech APIs</title>

      <description>


&lt;p&gt;What really makes Google Analytics stand apart from other analytics solutions for me is its integration with the Google Cloud, such as BigQuery and its machine learning APIs. An example of this integration is given in this workshop video that details how to use the &lt;a href=&#34;https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/core/v4/&#34;&gt;Google Analytics&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/&#34;&gt;Text-to-speech&lt;/a&gt; APIs to create a dashboard that talks through your statistics.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Five Ways to Schedule R scripts on Google Cloud Platform</title>
      <link>https://code.markedmondson.me/4-ways-schedule-r-scripts-on-google-cloud-platform/</link>

      <description>


&lt;p&gt;A common question I come across is how to automate scheduling of R scripts downloading data. This post goes through some options that I have played around with, which I’ve mostly used for downloading API data such as Google Analytics using the Google Cloud platform, but the same principles could apply for AWS or Azure.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>My R Packages</title>

      <description>A full list of R packages I have published are on my Github, but some notable ones are below.
Some are part of the cloudyR project, which has many packages useful for using R in the cloud. I concentrate on the Google cloud below, but be sure to check out the other packages if you’re looking to work with AWS or other cloud based services.

      <title>Insights sorting by delta metrics in the Google Analytics API v4</title>
      <link>https://code.markedmondson.me/quicker-insight-sort-metric-delta/</link>

      <description>As analysts, we are often called upon to see how website metrics have improved or declined over time. This is easy enough when looking at trends, but if you are looking to break down over other dimensions, it can involve a lot of ETL to get to what you need.
For instance, if you are looking at landing page performance of SEO traffic you can sort by the top performers, but not by the top most improved performers.</description>

      <title>Efficient anti-sampling with the Google Analytics Reporting API</title>
      <link>https://code.markedmondson.me/anti-sampling-google-analytics-api/</link>

      <description>Avoiding sampling is one of the most common reasons people start using the Google Analytics API. This blog lays out some pseudo-code to do so in an efficient manner, avoiding too many unnecessary API calls. The approach is used in the v4 calls for the R package googleAnalyticsR.
Avoiding the daily walk The most common approach to mitigate sampling is to break down the API calls into one call per day.</description>

      <description>In this blog we look at a method to estimate where to prioritise your SEO resources, estimating which keywords will give the greatest increase in revenue if you could improve their Google rank.
Overview Thanks to Vincent at data-seo.com who proof read and corrected some errors in the first draft
